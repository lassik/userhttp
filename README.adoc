# webhere

Allows local users on Unix systems (Linux, BSD, MacOS) to easily run
their own web server for personal use on the same computer.

## Use with privatetcp

The idea is that root runs a https://github.com/lassik/privatetcp[TCP
multiplexer] that listens on port 80 (HTTP). Whenever a connection is
made to that port, the multiplexer asks the OS which local user
initiated the TCP connection. The multiplexer then changes to that
user account and runs `webhere` to serve HTTP content as that user
from that user's home directory. So all users connect to the same port
80 (HTTP) but each users sees a completely personalized view of the
server contents, controlled completely by themselves while securely
isolated from other users.
